## Business Problem
Many organizations experience strong sales growth but struggle with inconsistent or declining profitability.
This often happens due to hidden profit leakage caused by excessive discounting, inefficient pricing strategies,
and unprofitable product or regional performance.

Despite healthy revenue numbers, decision-makers lack clear visibility into where and why profits are being lost.
This creates a gap between sales performance and actual business success.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales, pricing, cost, and discount data to identify the key drivers
of profit leakage. The analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between revenue, discounts, and profit
across products and regions, and to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve profitability.

## Key Business Questions
- Which regions generate high revenue but low profitability?
- How do discounts impact profit margins across regions and products?
- Are certain products driving sales volume while eroding profit?
- Is profit leakage primarily driven by pricing strategy or sales volume?

## Success Metrics
- Identification of high-revenue, low-profit regions
- Quantification of discount impact on profit margins
- Detection of loss-making or low-margin products
- Clear, actionable recommendations for pricing and margin improvement
